<p>
This Beta version of OMERO.importer has been rigorously tested to ensure 
it works as expected. As development is ongoing, however, it is possible 
that an error may occur when using the OMERO suite of applications. 
In such a case, a window will appear (<a href="#figure_4">Figure 5.2-1</a>) 
inviting you to 
submit feedback about what you were doing when the error occurred.
</p>
<p>
Providing this information is not required, but submitting as much information 
as you are able to provide will help the development team identify and overcome 
the cause of the error. You may include an email address - if you do, this will
 only be used to contact you for more information about the error you 
 experienced. This is optional, and you can choose to submit feedback 
 anonymously if you prefer.
