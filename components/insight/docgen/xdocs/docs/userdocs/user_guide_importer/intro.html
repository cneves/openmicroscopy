This document provides a brief guide to the Beta 
version of the OMERO.importer software, released for general use 
in January 2007. With this tool, you will be able to 
import <i>Deltavision</i>(<code>.dv</code>) files, <i>Metamorph</i> (<code>.stk</code>) files, 
and single plain <i>TIFF</i> (<code>.tiff</code>) files into an OMERO.server's database, and 
then view them using the OMERO.insight client. Additional formats, 
such as the <i>LEICA (.lei)</i> format, are planned for release in the near 
future.
