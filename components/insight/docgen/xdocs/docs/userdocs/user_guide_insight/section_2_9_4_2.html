<p>
A third option for viewing different z-sections and timepoints exists 
when an image is shown in Standard View and Annotation View. 
Holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse 
vertically up or down the image moves through z-sections; 
dragging horizontally moves through timepoints. Dragging diagonally will 
simultaneously change z-sections and timepoints.
