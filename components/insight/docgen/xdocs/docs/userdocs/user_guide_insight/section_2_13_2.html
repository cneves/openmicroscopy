<p>It is worth familiarising yourself with the Measurement Tool user interface, 
shown in <a href="section_2_13.html#figure_48">Figure 3.10-1</a>. 
It consists of two key areas -
a series of buttons identified 
by icons, and below that a series of tabbed navigation options. Additionally, 
there are menu options available at the top of the application window, 
and in specific situations, available by right-clicking the mouse.
</p>
<p>
The Measurement Tool has a toolbar giving access to the key features of the tool, 
shown in Figure 2:
<a href="#figure_49">Figure 3.10.2-1</a>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="left">
    <img src="images/measurementToolToolBar.jpg" 
    alt="Measurement Tool toolbar"></img></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="10">&#160;</td></tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="left"><a name="figure_49"><b>Figure 3.10.2-1</b></a>: 
    <b>Measurement Tool toolbar</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"></td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
Below this are a series of tabs giving access to key views of data 
relating to ROIs present in the selected image 
(see <a href="#figure_50">Figure 3.10.2-2</a>).
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="left">
    <img src="images/measurementToolAndTabNavigation.jpg" 
    alt="Measurement Tool's tab navigation"></img></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="10">&#160;</td></tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="left"><a name="figure_50"><b>Figure 3.10.2-2</b></a>: 
    <b>Measurement Tool's tab navigation</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"></td></tr>
</table>
</p>
<p>
In turn, these tabs give access to the following features of the Measurement Tool:
<ul>
<li><b>Manager</b> shows a hierarchical view of all ROIs and constituent 
shapes present in the image. 
This allows you to select an individual ROI shape or ROI (a collection of shapes) 
for analysis or editing.</li>
<li><b>Inspector</b> allows you to edit the appearance of an individual ROI shape, 
including colour of line, fill and any text associated with the image.</li>
<li><b>Results</b> view shows a summary of key measurement data for all ROI 
shapes present. It allows you to select an individual ROI shape 
for further detailed analysis.</li>
<li><b>Graph Pane</b> generates graphical representations - histogram and, for line 
ROI shapes, line plots of intensity values, by channel, for the selected ROI 
shape. These can be saved as images.</li>
<li><b>Intensity View</b> provides numerical data of individual pixel intensity 
values plus values such as mean, maximum and minimum values, plus an option to 
export this data for viewing in spreadsheet applications, such as Excel, as a 
CSV file.</li>
</ul>
