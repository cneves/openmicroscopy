  <title>The OMERO Data Model and Hierarchies</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
All information in OMERO revolves around a data structure 
called the object hierarchy. 
An understanding of this is core to efficient and effective use of OMERO. 
This hierarchy defines three kinds of objects:
<ol>
<li>Projects</li>
<li>Datasets</li>
<li>Images</li>
</ol>
and an organisational structure for grouping these objects together. 
This structure is shown in

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
    <img src="images/hierarchy.jpg" 
    alt="OMERO Object hierarchy"></img></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="10">&#160;</td></tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="center"><a name="figure_47"><b>Figure 5.4-1</b></a>: 
    OMERO Object hierarchy</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"></td></tr>
</table>

</p>
<p>
At the top of the object hierarchy is the <b>project</b>. 
Projects represent a large, long-term investigation, usually by either a 
single OMERO user or a small collection of users in the same research group.
</p>
<p>
Each project contains a number of <b>datasets</b>. Projects and datasets 
form a many-to-many relationship; a project can contain more than one dataset, 
and each dataset can belong to more than one project. Most analysis routines 
are performed at the dataset level. This provides both a convenient batch 
processing capability, and the ability to calculate aggregate information 
about the contents of a dataset.
</p>
<p>
Each dataset contains a number of <b>images</b>. Like projects, images form 
a many-to-many relationship with datasets. Images in OMERO are inherently 
multi-dimensional - they consist of pixels across the usual three spatial 
dimensions, and can include multiple colour channels and time series.
