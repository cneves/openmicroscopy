<p>
To change the magnification of the Graph view, right click on the histogram or 
line profile. This brings up a menu that allows you to:
<ul>
<li>Apply a 'zoom in' or 'zoom out' effect to the data by changing the visible 
values of the x and/or y axes, increasing or reducing the range of values shown 
in the graph.</li>
<li>Apply an automatic scaling effect so that the ranges of the x and y 
axes accommodate exactly the maximum and minimum values of the intensity 
data of the ROI shape in question.</li>
</ul>
If the selected ROI shape is part of a multidimensional ROI, slider bars 
will be provided to allow you to move through each timepoint and/or z-section, 
in a similar way to the Image View window. In the example shown in 
<a href="section_2_13_6_3_1.html#figure_60">Figure 3.10.6.3.1-1</a>, 
the vertical slider bar to the left of the figure allows you to change 
the z-section for which the intensity data should be shown.
