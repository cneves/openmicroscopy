<p>
One advantage of the Annotation View mode of the Image Viewer is that it 
allows you to add annotations to an image while looking at it in 
some detail (see <a href="#figure_37">Figure 3.9.2.5-1</a>).
</p>
<p>
In this view, the Annotations panel is shown in a similar way to the 
Data Manager, showing any existing annotations plus the name 
of the user who added the annotation and the date they were added; 
like in Data Manager you can add annotations to the image as desired.
</p>
<p>
Note that the annotations exist as separate text attributes of the image -
the image file itself is not annotated.
