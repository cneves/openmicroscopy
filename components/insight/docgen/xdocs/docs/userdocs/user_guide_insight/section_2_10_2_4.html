  <title>Managing images in the Hierarchy Viewer</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>In the Hierarchy Viewer, you can perform management actions on a single 
image or multiple images:
<ul>
<li>Categorise or decategorise an image or selection of images.</li><li>View and edit annotations for an image or selection of images.</li><li>View property information of an individual image.</li><li>Remove an image from its current dataset.</li>
</ul>
To perform any of these tasks, you can:
<ul>
<li>Select one or more images in a container, and then open the 
<b><i>Edit</i></b> menu to select the operation of your choice.</li><li>Or, right-click on a single image to see the  <b><i>Edit</i></b> menu 
as above.</li>
</ul>
Icons are used to indicate the presence of category and annotations for any 
image appearing as a thumbnail in the Hierarchy Viewer; this iconic information 
is preserved for pinned up thumbnails.
</p>
<p>
Clicking on an icon will bring up the corresponding tab in the Working area 
(see <a href="section_2_10_2_5.html">Section 3.10.2.5</a>)
