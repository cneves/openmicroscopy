  <title>The OMERO Environment: client and server</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
OMERO's design follows a standard client-server architecture. 
A single installation of an OMERO server will usually be used for an entire 
laboratory or imaging facility. Image data and metadata are typically stored on 
a central computer running the OMERO server, and then accessed via a 
standard Ethernet network using OMERO client applications that run on a 
user's workstation or laptop computer.

<p>
The OMERO Server manages all image metadata (date, size, channel names, etc.) 
but also contains an image rendering facility that generates fully rendered 
images, ready for display in an OMERO client application.
