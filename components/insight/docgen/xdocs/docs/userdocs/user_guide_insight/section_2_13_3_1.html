  <title>What is an ROI?</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
In OMERO, we use the following definitions:
<ul>
<li>ROI - a multi-dimensional object, consisting of one or more ROI shapes, 
indicated by the icon:
<img src="images/roistack16.jpg" width="16" height="16"/>.  
</li>
<li>ROI shape - a two dimensional object that appears on one plane only, 
indicated by the icon: 
<img src="images/roishape16.jpg" width="16" height="16"/>.</li>
</ul>
An ROI shape also automatically exists as an ROI. An ROI 
across multiple dimensions (z-sections or timepoints) will be created when 
an individual ROI shape is selected and propagated.
</p>

Propagating ROI shapes to create multi-dimensional ROIs is discussed more 
in <a href="section_2_13_3_4.html">Section 3.10.3.4</a>. 
Viewing and managing ROIs and ROI shapes is discussed more 
in <a href="section_2_13_5.html">Section 3.10.5</a> and in
<a href="section_2_13_6.html">Section 3.10.3.6</a>.
