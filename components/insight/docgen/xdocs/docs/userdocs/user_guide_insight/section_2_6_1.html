The  <img src="images/annotated_image16.jpg" width="16" height="16"/> icon

To view annotations in the Data Manager:
<ol>
<li>Select the image or dataset for which you wish to see the annotations.</li>
<li>Select the Annotation tab in the right-hand pane.</li>
<li>A window appears with two panes
(see <a href="section_2_6_2.html#figure_21">Figure 3.6.2-1</a>):
<ul>
<li>
The left-hand pane shows a tree-list of all annotations for the selected image, 
dataset or project, plus date and time the annotation was made. 
Annotations are grouped by users, allowing you to see any annotations made 
by other users.</li>
<li>The right-hand pane provides an area for you to add a new annotation; 
it also shows the content of all existing annotations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
You can also view an image's annotation(s) in the Image Viewer
 - see <a href="section_1_4_1.html">Section 2.4.1</a>, or in the Hierarchy 
 Viewer - see <a href="section_2_10.html">Section 3.10</a>.
