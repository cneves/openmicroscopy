<p>
To remove a project or dataset:
<ol>
<li>In the left-hand pane of the Data Manager, 
select the project or dataset to be removed.</li>
<li>In the <b><i>Edit</i></b> menu, select Remove 
(or <b><i>Remove from current project</i></b> for a dataset). 
This removes the selected project or dataset. 
'Orphaned Datasets' will be created to hold the removed dataset(s).</li>
<li>The removed projects or datasets will go to 'Orphaned Datasets', 
which appears on top of the tree view. The number in the bracket shows how many 
removed datasets are in. </li>

</ol>
</p>

  <div class="noteContent">
 When you remove a project, the dataset(s) in it will be listed in the 
 'Orphaned Datasets' and therefore you will not see the name of the 
 project but only the dataset(s). 
 A project or dataset is only removed from a project - it is not deleted from 
 the system.
