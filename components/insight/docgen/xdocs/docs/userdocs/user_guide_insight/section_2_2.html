You can make a limited amount of changes to your OMERO account details 
in the Data Manager.
</p>
<p>
At the top of the tree in the left-hand pane of the Data Manager is your 
own user name. Click on this to see your user account details, 
shown in the right-hand pane (see <a href="#figure_10"><b>Figure 3.2-1</b></a>). 
There are two tabs:
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>My Profile</i></b> shows basic personal information.</li>
<li><b><i>My Servers</i></b> shows all OMERO servers for which you have a user 
account.</li>
</ul>

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="left">
    <img src="images/userProfile.jpg" 
    alt="User Profile Editor"></img></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="10">&#160;</td></tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="left"><a name="figure_10"><b>Figure 3.2-1</b></a>
  <b>: User Profile Editor</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"></td></tr>
</table>

 The only edits you can make at present is to change your OMERO 
 password using the form here. Future releases of OMERO will allow you 
 to make additional changes to your account, which currently can only 
 be made by users with OMERO administrator status. The ability to change 
 from one server to another will also be added in future versions.
