<p>For images with multiple z-sections or timepoints, 
OMERO allows you to easily view these manually or automatically.
</p>
<p>
To manually view composite z-sections or timepoints for an image in 
the <b><i>Image Viewer</i></b> window (all three views):
<ul>
<li>Use the vertical Z slider to manually view individual z-sections.</li>
<li>Use the horizontal T slider to manually view individual timepoints.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Or, open the <b><i>Controls</i></b> menu and select the <b><i>Movie</i></b>
 option to open the <b>Movie Player</b>. 
Here you can play all z-sections or timepoints in sequence, as a movie.<br/>
Alternatively, 
Holding down the mouse button and dragging the mouse 
vertically up or down the image moves through z-sections; 
dragging horizontally moves through timepoints. Dragging diagonally will 
simultaneously change z-sections and timepoints.
</p>
<p>
For more details on viewing z-sections and timepoints using the Movie Player, 
see <a href="section_2_9_4.html">Section 3.9.4</a>.
