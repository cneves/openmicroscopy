  <title>Viewing a selection of images: the Hierarchy Viewer</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
A selection of images for viewing can be made at different levels,
based on how your data is organised in OMERO. You can:
<ul>
<li>Select one or more projects - this selects all images in each dataset
belonging to the selected project(s) groups.</li>
<li>Select one or more datasets - this selects all images in the selected 
datasets.</li>
<li>Select one or more images, by using the keyboard and/or mouse to select 
more than one image filename from the list shown in the left-hand pane.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<div class="noteFrame">
  <div class="noteLabel">NB</div>
  <div class="noteContent">
 You can also select images according to the Category 
 they belong to, which is another way of organising your data - you define 
 your own category groups and categories, and then you can place your 
 images into one or more categories. For more on categories, see 
 <a href="section_2_7.html">Section 3.7</a>.
 </div>
</div> 
<p>
To view a selection of images:
<ol>
<li>In the Data Manager, select the first project, dataset, 
category group, category or image you wish to view by clicking once to 
highlight it.</li>
<li>
Use the appropriate keys for your operating system to select subsequent 
projects, datasets, category groups, categories or images. 
<div class="noteFrame">
  <div class="noteLabel">NB</div>
  <div class="noteContent">
  You can only select multiple objects of the same level - for example you 
  can select 5 images, but not one dataset plus 5 images. 
  However, you can select individual datasets from different projects if desired.
 </div>
</div> 
<br/>
</li>
<li>Once you have your selection, select the Browse button  
<img src="images/viewer16.jpg" width="16" height="16"/>. 
This brings up a Hierarchy Viewer window showing a series of thumbnails, 
one for each image in your selection (see <a href="#figure_8"><b>Figure 2.4.2-1</b></a>).
 </li>
</ol> 

<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="left">
    <img src="images/hiSingleSelection.jpg" 
    alt="Hierarchy Viewer, showing simple selection of images"></img></td> 
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="10">&#160;</td></tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="left"><a name="figure_8"><b>Figure 2.4.2-1</b></a>: 
    <b>Hierarchy Viewer, showing simple selection of images</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"></td></tr>
</table>

</p>
<p>
The Hierarchy Viewer also provides:
<ul>
<li>a range of tools for viewing individual thumbnails;</li>
<li>options to rearrange the display of thumbnails;</li>
<li>facilities to display and edit information relating to  a particular 
thumbnail.</li>
</ul>
See <a href="section_2_10_2.html">Section 3.10.2</a> for more details.
