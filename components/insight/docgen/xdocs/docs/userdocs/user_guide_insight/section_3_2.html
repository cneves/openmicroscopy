<p>
This Beta version of OMERO.importer and OMERO.insight has been rigorously 
tested to ensure 
it works as expected. Errors however may occur and a window will appear 
(<a href="#figure_45">Figure 4.2-1</a>) 
inviting you to submit feedback about  the error.
</p>
<p>
Providing this information is not required, but will help the 
development team identify and overcome the cause of the error. 
Submitting your email address is optional, and if you do, this 
information will only be used to contact you for more details 
about what you were doing when the error occurred.
