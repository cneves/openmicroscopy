<p>
To add a user to a user group: 
<ul>
<li>Select the user in the user list.</li>
<li>
Select the group you wish the user to belong to in the group list in the
bottom left corner of the <i>Users</i> tab
(<a href="section_3_1.html#figure4">Figure 3.1-2</a>).
If the group does not appear there but in the bottom right of
 the <i>Users</i> tab, the user already belongs to the group.
</li>
<li>
 Once the user and group have been selected, 
 click on the add user to group button.

 </li>
 </ul>
 The group should move from the group list in the bottom left 
 to the list in the bottom right. The user is now a member of this group.
