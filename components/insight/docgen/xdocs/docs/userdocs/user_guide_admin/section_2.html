Depending on your operating system, OMERO.admin will either come as a 
simple zipped archive file, or as a bundled installation package. 
If you have downloaded the archive file, you will need to extract it with a 
program capable of opening <code>.zip</code> files. If you have downloaded the 
install package, double-click it to start the installation process and then 
follow the steps presented.
