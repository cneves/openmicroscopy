<p><b>Setting up the Weblitz Interface</b></p>

<p><b>The Weblitz Interface Dependancies</b></p>

<p>To actually use weblitz you'll need django and pysqlite, for which has 
a small script that grabs and compiles both for inplace usage 
(i.e. not system wide).</p> 

Just run <code>python weblitz_prepare.sh</code>

<p>Currently weblitz has prerequisites for</p>
<ol>
<li>
	pysqlite-2.3.5
</li>
<li>
	django SVN revision 6652+
</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't want, can't compile and install django and, or 
pysqlite this way, just grab them and install system wide by whatever means 
you have available. Weblitz currently targeting pysqlite-2.3.5 and django's 
trunk from svn at revision 6652, but newer versions will almost certainly work.</p>

<p><b>The Weblitz Interface in Detail</b></p>

<p>A few other dependencies need to be satisfied to run the weblitz app,
 but if you don't want to actually use weblitz but just see how it connects 
 and talks to the blitz server, you can check 
 <code>weblitz/blitzcon/blitz_connector.py</code> that has all the logic in.</p>

<p><b>Running the Server</b></p>

<p>When all is done, run <code>python manage.py runserver</code></p>
<p> Visit <code>localhost:8000/admin</code> to set up at least one Stored Connection. 
The base path will be the url you need to use to access that particular 
connection.</p>
