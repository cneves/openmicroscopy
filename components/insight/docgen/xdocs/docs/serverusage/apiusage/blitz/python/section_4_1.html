<p><b>Slice and OMERO.Blitz</b></p>
</div>

<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>The OMERO.Blitz API is contructed using ICE's slice definition language. 
A specification language for ICE it defines the contract between client and 
server and persistant data.</p>

<p>The slice definitions for the OMERO.Blitz server are located at 
YOUR_OMERO_DIR/components/blitz/resources/omero. The slice files are broken it 
different sections. The omero/ ice files are the central definitions of the blitz
implementation. They provide an Ice facade over the existing
OMERO.server architecture. Due to the increased overhead of
creating implementations in multiple languages, the mappings are
simplified and work mostly as simple data transfer objects. </p>

<p>The main files of interest are</p>
<ol>
<li>
	API.ice which contains the slice definition for the services and session calls. 
</li>
<li>
	RTypes.ice which defines the primitive OMERO.Blitz persistant data types.
</li>
<li>
	System.ice defines some basic class objects used in the API calls, for instance
	<code>omero.system.Parameters</code> is used to set the search context of the 
	<code>getUserImages()</code> in the IPojoService.
</li>
<li>
	ServerErrors.ice contains all the exceptions thrown by the server.
</li>
<li>
	Constants.ice has all the constants used in the API calls in the API.ice.
</li>
</ol>
