<p><b>OMERO.Blitz Types</b></p>
</div>

<p>The OMERO.Blitz server uses some specific types and wrappers to primitive
types in its API calls</p>

<p>These types can be split into 2 categories</p>
<ol>
<li>
Simple types - These are basic types that have been wrapped by the 
OMERO.Blitz API. Each type is proceeded by an R - so RInt, RLong, RDouble. 
</li>
<li>
Abstract data types - These are the complex, ADT structures used by the 
OMERO.Blitz API.
</li>
</ol>

<p>The slice definition of all the RTypes used in OMERO.Blitz can be found in 
YOUR_OMERO_DIR/components/blitz/resources/omero/RTypes.ice</p>
