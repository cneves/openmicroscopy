<p><b>Interpreting the Slice definitions in API.ice</b></p>

<p>This chapter is going to give an overview of the slice language as it pertains to
intepreting the methods available in the OMERO.Blitz server. A more detailed manual
on the Slice language can be found at 
<a href="http://www.zeroc.com/doc/Ice-3.2.1/manual/Hello.4.2.html#49352">
Slice Chapter -- ICE Manual</a>.</p>

<p>The API.ice file contains all of the service alls that are exposed to the client.
Slice files are broken into separate sections.</p>

<ol>
<li>
	Module -- This is the namespace definitions in the Slice language.
</li>
<li>
	Interface -- An interface definition can be thought of as the equivalent 
	of a Java interface, and of operation definitions as (virtual) member 
	functions. In an interface only the operation definitions are allowed to 
	appear. You may not define types, exceptions or datamembers inside an interface.
	This does not mean that an object which is defined by an Interface is stateless.
</li>
<li>
	Class -- Similar to an interface a class can have exception, datatype and datamembers 
	defined in it.
</li>
<li>
	Struct -- A Stuct defines a datatype which may be used to pass intformation 
	via the ICE interface.
</li>
</ol>
