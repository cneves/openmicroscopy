Now we only need talk a little bit about how events are fired and 
eventually dispatched. The event bus sits idle after creation. When a 
subscriber invokes the <code>register</code> or <code>remove</code> method, 
the de-multiplex table is updated accordingly and then the event bus returns 
to idle. The interesting bit is when a publisher invokes <code>postEvent() 
</code>passing in <code>e</code> - an instance of a subclass of 
<code>AgentEvent</code>. Now the event bus enters into its dispatching loop 
and delivers <code>e</code> (by calling the <code>eventFired</code> method) 
to all subscribers in the event notification list of <code>e</code>. If one 
of those subscribers happens to be the object that initially posted 
<code>e</code>, then it is not notified - that is, an event is never dispatched 
back to its source.
</p>
<p>
 We stated that the event bus can be regarded as a time-ordered event queue - 
if event A is posted on the bus before event B, then event A is also 
delivered before event B. How do we enforce this? First off, all methods 
of the event bus are run within the same thread that runs the agents -
 the <i>Swing</i> dispatching thread. Whenever the container needs access 
 the event bus from another thread (the rendering engine runs in a 
 separate thread), it uses a trick (<code>invokeLater</code> method of 
 <code>SwingUtilities</code>) to have the invoked method run within the 
 <i>Swing</i> dispatching thread. So, in any case, the event dispatching 
 loop runs synchronously with respect to the publisher that calls 
 <code>postEvent()</code>. This leaves us with only one thing that 
 could break time-ordering: nested dispatching loops. This can happen 
 if a subscriber calls 
 <code>postEvent()</code> from <code>eventFired()</code>, that is,
  while an event is being dispatched, some listener fires a new event 
  in response to the current event notification. In this case, we 
  have to dispatch the new event only after the current event has been 
  delivered to all the subscribers in the event notification list. This
   is easily achieved by using an event queue and by checking the state 
   of the event  bus every time <code>postEvent</code> is invoked: if 
   the bus is already running its dispatching loop, <code>postEvent</code> 
   simply adds the passed event to the queue and returns.
</p>
<p>
The event bus' state machine is illustrated by the following UML state-chart.

<p>
A final note on time-ordering. We added this constraint to the event bus in
 order to maintain consistency. In fact, if the dispatching loop doesn't 
 deliver the events in the same order in which they were posted, the agents 
 might not behave correctly.
