 If you're wondering why requests and responses are organized in such a 
 fancy way, keep on reading this explanation of how the Asynchronous 
 Completion Token pattern works in our case. </p>
 <p>
 As we mentioned earlier, a concrete <code>RequestEvent</code> encapsulates a 
 request to execute an asynchronous operation. Asynchrony involves a separation 
 in space and time between invocation and processing of the result of an 
 operation: we request the execution of the operation at some point in 
 time within a given call stack (say in <code>methodX</code> we make a new 
 request and we post it on the event bus). Then, at a later point in time 
 and within another call stack (<code>eventFired</code> method), we receive 
 a notification that the execution has completed and we have to handle this 
 completion event -
  which mainly boils down to doing something with the result, if any, of 
  the operation. Recall that the <code>ResponseEvent</code> class is used for 
  representing a completion event and a concrete subclass carries the result 
  of the operation, if any. After the operation has completed, a concrete 
  <code>ResponseEvent</code> is put on the event bus so that the object which 
  initially made the request (often an agent, but, in this context, we'll 
  refer to it as the initiator, which is obviously required to implement the 
  <code>AgentEventListener</code> interface and register with the event bus) 
  can be notified that execution has completed and possibly handle the result. 
  Thus, at some point in time the initiator's <code>eventFired</code> method 
  is called passing in the response object. 
 </p>
 <p>
 Now the initiator has to find out which processing action has to be dispatched 
 to handle the response. Moreover, the processing action often needs to know 
 about the original invocation context - unfortunately, we can't relinquish 
 the original call stack (<code>methodX</code> is gone). The solution is to 
 require that a response be linked to the original request and that the 
 initiator link a request to a completion handler (which encapsulates the 
 processing action) before posting it on the event bus (this explains the 
 fancy arrangement of the <code>RequestEvent</code>, <code>ResponseEvent</code> 
 and <code>CompletionHandler</code>).
</p>
<p>
This way de-multiplexing matters are made very easy for the initiator. Upon 
reception of a completion event notification, all what the initiator has to 
do is to ask the response object to start the de-multiplexing process -
by calling the complete method. This method calls <code>handleCompletion()</code>
on the original request, passing in the response object. In turn, 
<code>handleCompletion()</code> calls the handle method on its completion 
handler, passing in both the request and the response. Voila', the right 
processing action has been dispatched to handle the response. Also, notice that 
the completion handler is linked to the request in the original invocation
context, which makes it possible to provide the handler with all the needed 
information from the invocation context. Moreover, both the original request
and the corresponding response are made available to the completion handler. 
This is enough to provide the completion handler with a suitable execution 
context - all the needed information from the original call stack is now 
available to the processing action.
