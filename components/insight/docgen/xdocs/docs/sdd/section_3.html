<p>
We devise two common categories of events:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Events that serve as a notification of state change.</li>
<li>Events that represent invocation requests and completion of asynchronous operations.
</li>
 </ul>
 In the first category fall those events that an agent posts on 
 the event bus to notify other agents of a change in its internal state. 
 Events in the second category are meant to support asynchronous 
 communication between agents and  components.
 The <code>AgentEvent</code> class, which represents the generic event type, 
 is sub-classed in order to create a hierarchy that represents the above 
 categories. Thus, on one hand we have an abstract <code>StateChangeEvent</code>
  class from which agents derive concrete classes to represent state 
  change notifications. On the other hand, the <code>RequestEvent</code> 
  and <code>ResponseEvent</code> abstract classes are sub-classed by 
  the container in order to define, respectively, how to request the 
  asynchronous execution of a rendering operation and how to represent 
  its completion. We use the Asynchronous Completion Token pattern 
  <a href="pos_a2">[POSA2]</a>
  to dispatch processing actions in response to the completion of 
  asynchronous operations.
