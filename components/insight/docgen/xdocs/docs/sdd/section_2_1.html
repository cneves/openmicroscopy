Interactions among agents are event-driven. 
Agents communicate by using a shared event bus provided by the container. 
The event bus is an event propagation mechanism loosely based on 
the Publisher-Subscriber <a href="biblio.html#pos_a1">[POSA1]</a> pattern and can be regarded as a 
time-ordered event queue - if event A is posted on the bus before event B, 
then event A is also delivered before event B. Events are fired by creating an 
instance of a subclass of <code>AgentEvent</code> and by posting it on the 
event bus. Agents interested in receiving notification of 
<code>AgentEvent</code> occurrences implement the <code>AgentEventListener</code>
interface and register with the event bus. 
This interface has a callback method, <code>eventFired</code>, that the event 
bus invokes in order to dispatch an event. A listener typically registers 
interest only for some given events - by specifying a list of 
<code>AgentEvent</code> subclasses when registering with the event bus. 
The event bus will then take care of event de-multiplexing - an event is 
eventually dispatched to a listener only if the listener registered for that 
kind of event.
