To make the above discussion a bit more concrete, we need add some more 
detail. So here's an UML class diagram to uncover the 
<code>AgentEvent</code>'s hierarchy and the use of the 
Asynchronous Completion Token pattern:  
</p>
<p>
As stated above, <code>StateChangeEvent</code> is an abstract 
class from which agents derive concrete classes to represent state 
change notifications. Its state field can be used to carry all 
state-change information, as in the One Message Per Change 
Request pattern <a href="biblio.html#plop_2">[PLoP2]</a>. Where multiple fields are preferable, a 
subclass can add this extra functionality.
</p>
<p>
The <code>RequestEvent</code> abstract class is a generic type to 
represent a request to execute an asynchronous operation. A concrete 
subclass encapsulates the actual request. We require that every 
<code>RequestEvent</code> object be linked to the processing action 
that has to be dispatched upon completion of the asynchronous operation.
 The <code>RequestEvent</code> class factors out this association as 
 well as the dispatching logic. A processing action is encapsulated by 
 a class that implements the <code>CompletionHandler</code> interface.
</p>
<p>
The <code>ResponseEvent</code> abstract class is a generic type to 
represent the completion of an asynchronous operation. A concrete 
subclass encapsulates the result of the operation, if any. Every 
<code>ResponseEvent</code> object is required to be linked to the 
<code>RequestEvent</code> object that originated it. Thus, whenever a 
response is received, it's always possible to identify the corresponding 
processing action by means of the linked request object -
 therefore <code>RequestEvent</code> plays the role of an asynchronous 
 completion token (ACT). The <code>ResponseEvent</code> class factors out 
 the logic to activate the de-multiplexing of a completion event to the 
 processing action.
