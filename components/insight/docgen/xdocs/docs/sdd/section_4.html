The container provides a top-level window, the taskbar, to let users control
 some of the container's tasks like the connection to the remote service or 
 quitting the application. The taskbar contains a menu bar and several toolbars. 
 Agents can add their own entries to the menu bar and to the toolbars in order 
 to trigger agent-specific actions. For example, agents that a UI typically add 
 entry to the <i>Window</i> menu and to the <i>Quick-launch</i> toolbar (this 
 should be done during the agent's linking phase) for top-level windows that 
 the user can bring up. Even though agents can ignore the taskbar altogether - 
 this is especially so for those agents, like <i>Viewer</i>, that bring up their 
 UI only in response to a given event being posted on the event bus. 
Some utility classes provide agents with functuinality to link their top-level 
windows to the taskbar and to manage the display of those windows on screen.
