The container provides a flexible and extensible configuration mechanism. 
Each agent has its own configuration file which is parsed at start-up by the container. 
The configuration entries in this file are turned into objects 
and collected into a map-like object, which is then passed to the agent. 
This map object also contains pointers to the container's services. 
Thus, we can think of this object as a <i>Registry</i> <a href="biblio.html#fow_03">[Fow03]</a>. 
There is one 
<code>Registry</code> for each agent, so configuration entries are 
private to each agent - container's services are shared among all agents though. 
The container also has its own configuration file and Registry.

<p>
The container maintains a set of predefined bindings 
that are used to convert a configuration entry into an object 
- such as a <code>String</code>, <code>Integer</code>, <code>Font</code>, 
<code>IconFactory</code>, etc. However, agents can specify custom handlers 
for converting a configuration entry into an object.
