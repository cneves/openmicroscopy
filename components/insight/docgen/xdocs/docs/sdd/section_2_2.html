So let's move on to describe roles and relationships of the classes needed 
to support the event bus mechanism. 
The following UML class diagram introduces the static structure of the participant classes.
TODO: ADD DIAGRAM
      </p>
<p>
The <code>EventBus</code> interface defines how client classes access 
the event bus service. A client object, typically an agent, uses the 
<code>register</code> method in order to be notified of occurrences of the 
specified event types - this is referred to as making subscriptions and the 
client object plays the role of a subscriber. The <code>remove</code> 
method cancels existing subscriptions. The <code>postEvent</code> method 
allows a client object (again this is typically an agent) to fire an event and 
put it on the event bus so that it can be delivered to all subscribers that 
registered interest in that type of event - the object that fires the event 
is referred to as being the publisher. For a subscriber to register interest in 
a given event type, this type has to be made known to subscribers - this is 
referred to as publishing an event. This happens (for the time being) at 
design time: an event is "published" by adding its class to the events 
package within the agents package.  
</p>
<p>
Notice that (because of the <code>register</code>/<code>remove</code> methods) 
the <code>EventBus</code> interface is seen by subscribers as a publisher. 
To a publisher, it looks like a subscriber (<code>postEvent</code> method). 
In this respect, the arrangement just described is similar to that of the 
<i>Event Channel </i>variant of the Publisher-Subscriber pattern 
<a href="biblio.html#pos_a1">[POSA1]</a>.
</p>
<p>
The <code>AgentEvent</code> abstract class is the ancestor of all classes 
that represent events. Its source field is meant to be a reference to the 
publisher that fired the event - this is used by the event bus to avoid 
dispatching an event back to its source if the event source is also a 
subscriber that registered for that event.
</p>
<p>
The <code>AgentEventListener</code> interface represents a subscriber 
to the event bus. It has to be implemented by all subscribers in order to 
register for event notification. It defines a callback method, 
<code>eventFired</code>, that the event bus invokes in order to 
dispatch an event. Notice that even though the only argument of this method is an 
<code>AgentEvent</code>, the event bus only dispatches events whose type
 is one of the event types that the subscriber registered interest in.  
</p>
<p>
The <code>EventBusImpl</code> implements the <code>EventBus</code> 
interface and is the pumping heart of the event propagation mechanism. 
It maintains a de-multiplex table to keep track of what events have to be 
dispatched to which subscribers. From an abstract standpoint, the 
de-multiplex table is the set of couples:
<pre class="code">
DT = { (eventClass, subscriber) }
</pre>
where <code>eventClass</code> is a class representing a concrete event and 
subscriber is an object that implements the <code>AgentEventListener</code> 
interface and has registered interest in the event type defined by 
<code>eventClass</code>. When the <code>postEvent</code> method is invoked, 
the passed <code>AgentEvent e</code> is dispatched to all listeners in the 
event notification
list of <code>e</code>:
<pre class="code">
EvNotifList(e) = { (x, y) in DT |  typeof(e)==x }
</pre>
</p>
<p>
The obvious mechanism to implement the de-multiplex table is a map in which 
each key is an event class and the corresponding value is a linked lists 
containing all the subscribers for that event type.
</p>
<p>
Notice that, even though a hierarchy of events can be defined by sub-classing 
<code>AgentEvent</code>, event de-multiplexing and dispatching is not polymorphic. 
This boils down to the fact that if event B's class extends event A's class 
and subscriber S registers interest only in event A, then S will never be 
notified of occurrences of event B.
Also notice that, because we treat <code>DT</code> as a set, a subscriber 
may not register twice for the same event - this would cause the subscriber 
to be notified twice for every occurrence of that event, so no matter how 
many times a subscriber tries to register for an event, it will only be
added once to the corresponding event notification list.
