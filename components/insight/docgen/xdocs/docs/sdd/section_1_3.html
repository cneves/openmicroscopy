<p>The following UML sequence diagram outlines how a configuration
file is parsed and the corresponding <code>Registry</code> is built. 
[TODO:ADD DIAGRAM]

</p>
<p>
First off, a <code>RegistryImpl</code> object is created with an empty map. 
Then a <code>Parser</code> object is created passing the path to the 
configuration file and the 
<code>RegistryImpl</code> object. At this point <code>parse()</code> is 
invoked on the <code>Parser</code> object. The configuration file is read 
(the XML parsing is handled by built-in JAXP libraries) and, for each 
configuration entry (that is, either <i>entry</i> or <i>struturedEntry</i> tag), 
<code>createEntryFor() </code> is called to obtain a concrete
<code>Entry</code> object, which will handle the conversion of the tag's 
content into an object. This <code>Entry</code> object is then added to 
the map kept by the 
<code>RegistryImpl</code> object.  
</p>
<p>
In order to find out which class is in charge of handling a given tag, 
the <code>Entry</code> class maintains a map, <code>contentHandlers</code>, 
whose keys are the predefined values used for the <i>type</i> attribute 
("string",  "integer", "icons", etc.) and values are the fully qualified 
names of the handler classes. Given a tag, <code>createEntryFor()</code> 
uses the content of the <i>type</i> attribute (or "string" if this attribute 
is missing) to look up the class name in the map and then creates an instance 
by reflection - all <code>Entry</code>'s subclasses are supposed to have a 
no-args constructor. If the class name is not found in the map, then the 
content of the <i>type</i> attribute is assumed to be a valid fully qualified 
name of an <code>Entry</code>'s subclass. This allows for agents to specify 
custom handlers - as long as the handler extends <code>Entry</code> and has 
a public no-args constructor. 
</p>
<p>
Notice that the <code>RegistryImpl</code> object adds the couple 
(<code>e.getName(), e</code>) to its map. Because the <code>Entry</code> 
class takes care of setting the name field to the content of the 
<i>name</i> attribute within the entry tag, the application code can 
subsequently access <code>e</code> by specifying the value of the name attribute 
to <code>lookup()</code>.
<br/>
The above outlined process is repeated for each configuration file so that 
the configuration entries of each agent (and the container) are kept in 
separate objects -- a 
<code>RegistryImpl</code> is created every time. Because every agent is 
then provided with its own <code>RegistryImpl</code> object, the configuration 
entries are private to each agent. However, the container configures all 
<code>RegistryImpl</code> objects with the same references to its services.
