Agents can use the taskbar directly to add entries to the various menus and toolbars.  
After retrieving the <code>TaskBar</code> from the <code>Registry</code>, the 
<code>addXXX</code> and <code>removeXXX</code> are available to do the job.  
Here's what the taskbar looks like:
</p>
      <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="10" align="center">
        <tr>
       <td align="center"><img src="images/taskbar.gif"/></td>
		</tr>
		 </table>
<p>
Agents can add entries to any of the menus within the menu bar - <i>File</i>, 
<i>Connect</i>, <i>Tasks</i>, <i>Window</i>, <i>Help</i>.  
Two toolbars, <i>Tasks
</i> and <i>Quick-Launch</i>, are also provided for agents 
to plug in their buttons. Buttons in the <i>Tasks</i> toolbar are usually 
shortcuts to entries in the <i>Tasks</i> menu.  Similarly, buttons in 
the <i>Quick-Launch</i> toolbar are usually shortcuts to entries in the
 <i>Window</i> menu.  
</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>
However, some utility classes provide agents with built-in functionality 
to link their top-level windows to the taskbar and to manage the display 
of those windows on screen.  
</p>
<p>
The <code>TopWindow</code> class extends <code>JFrame</code> to provide 
the base functionality for windows that are to be linked to the <code>TaskBar</code>
by means of one quick-launch button and a menu entry in the <i>Window</i> menu. 
The constructor of this class automatically adds a button to the 
<i>Quick-Launch</i> toolbar and an entry in the <i>Window</i> menu -
 subclasses use the <code>configureXXX</code> methods to specify icons, 
 names, and tool tips. These are 
display-trigger buttons that cause the window to be shown on screen.  
This class uses the <code>TopWindowManager</code> to control mouse clicks on 
these buttons as well as to manage the display state of the window - how this 
display state is managed is specified by the <code>TopWindowManager</code> 
state machine, which is represented in one of the previous diagrams.
</p>
<p>
Here's an example of a window that inherits from <code>TopWindow</code>:
</p>
<pre class="code">
class MainWindow 
	extends TopWindow
{

	//Member fields omitted.		
	

	//Specifies names, icons, and tool tips for the quick-launch button and the
	//window menu entry in the taskbar.
	private void configureDisplayButtons()
	{
		configureQuickLaunchBtn(icons.getIcon("agent.png"), 
						"Display the main window.");
		configureWinMenuEntry("Example Agent", icons.getIcon("agent.png"));
	}
	
	//Builds and lays out this window.
	private void buildGUI() { /* Omitted. */ }
	
	


	//Creates a new instance.
	MainWindow(Registry config)
	{
		//We have to specify the title of the window to the superclass
		//constructor and pass a reference to the TaskBar, which we get
		//from the Registry.
		super("Example Agent", config.getTaskBar());
		
		configureDisplayButtons();
		buildGUI();
	}

}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>TopWindowGroup</code> class links a group of windows to the 
<code>TaskBar</code> and manages their display on screen. Rather than 
adding a quick-launch button in the <i>Quick-Launch</i> toolbar and an 
entry in the window menu for each window in the group, the constructor of 
this class adds a drop-down button (a button that triggers the display of 
a popup menu) to the <i>Quick-Launch</i> toolbar and a sub-menu to the 
<i>Window</i> menu. These menus contain an entry for each window in the 
group and are populated/depopulated via the <code>add/remove</code> methods. 
All those menu entries are display-trigger buttons that cause the 
corresponding window to be shown on screen. 
This class uses the <code>TopWindowManager</code> to control mouse clicks on 
these buttons as well as to manage the display state of each window in the group. 
</p>
<p>
The following <code>UIManager</code> class provides an example of how to use 
the <code>TopWindowGroup</code> class. This example class creates and controls
an instance of <code>MainWindow</code> (which we have already seen in the
 previous example) as well as  <code>AuxiliaryWindow</code> instances. This 
 latter class is just a window which contains two buttons and its code is 
 omitted. <code>UIManager</code> delegates to the <code>TopWindowGroup</code> 
 class the linkage of <code>AuxiliaryWindow</code>'s to the <code>TaskBar</code>
  as well as the management of their display state.
</p>
<p>
Follows the code:
</p>
<pre class="code">
class UIManager
{

	//Inherits from TopWindow, so it's automatically linked to the TaskBar.
	//Contains a button that we listen to.  When a mouse click occurs we call
	//createAuxWin().
	private MainWindow		mainWindow;
	
	//Manages all the AuxiliaryWindow's that we've created and not destroyed yet.
	private TopWindowGroup		auxWinGroup;
	
	//Counts how many {@link AuxiliaryWindow}'s we've created so far.
	private int			auxWinCount;
	
	//Cached reference to access the icons.
	private IconFactory		icons;

	
	//Creates a new instance.
	UIManager(Registry config)
	{
		
		auxWinCount = 0;
		icons = (IconFactory) config.lookup("/resources/icons/MyFactory");
		mainWindow = new MainWindow(config);

		//The MainWindow contains a button (not shown in the previous example) 
		//which we listen to in order to trigger the creation of new 
		//AuxiliaryWindows.		
		mainWindow.openAuxiliary.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) { createAuxWin(); }
		});

		


		//We now create the window group.  The text we pass will be displayed by
		//the sub-menu within the Window menu along with the icon, which will also
		//be the icon displayed by the drop-down button in the Quick-Launch
		//toolbar.
		auxWinGroup = new TopWindowGroup("Aux Win", 
					icons.getIcon("edu_languages.png"), 
					config.getTaskBar());
		
	}
	
	//Creates an AuxiliaryWindow and adds it to the auxWinGroup.
	//Every AuxiliaryWindow contains two buttons, one labeled "Close" and the other
	//"Dispose".  We listen to mouse clicks on these buttons in order to hide the
	//window when the "Close" button is clicked and to remove the window (and dispose
	//of it) from the auxWinGroup when the "Dispose" button is clicked.
	private void createAuxWin()
	{
		String title = "Aux Window "+(++auxWinCount);
		final AuxiliaryWindow aw = new AuxiliaryWindow(title);
		
		//Attach listeners and specify actions.
		aw.close.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {aw.setVisible(false);}
		});
		aw.dispose.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
			public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
				//Remove from group and dispose.
				auxWinGroup.remove(aw, true);
			}
		});
		
		//Add to the group.  An entry will be added both to the Window sub-menu
		//and to the popup menu triggered by the drop-down button in the
		//Quick-Launch toolbar.  We set the display text of those entries to be
		//the same as the window's title, but we don't specify any icon.
		auxWinGroup.add(aw, title, null);
		
		//Bring the window up.
		aw.open();
	}

	//Releases all UI resources currently in use and returns them to the OS.
	void disposeUI()
	{
		mainWindow.dispose();
		auxWinGroup.removeAll(true);  //Empty group and dispose of all windows.
	}
	
}
