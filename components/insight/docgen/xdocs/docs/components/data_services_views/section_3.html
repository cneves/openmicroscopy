<p>The Data Services Views component provides agents with specific views on the server 
  data. A data services view is a logical grouping of data and operations that serve 
  a specific purpose -- for example to support dataset browsing by providing easy 
  access to datasets, thumbnails, classifications, etc. A data services view is defined 
  by an interface that extends <code>DataServiceView</code> and consists of a collection 
  of asynchronous calls that operate on (possibly) large portions of a data model 
  in the background.</p>
<p>After retrieving a reference to an object implementing a given view, an agent calls 
  one of the view's methods and specifies an <code>AgentEventListener</code> to observe 
  the execution of the call. A handle to the call is returned to the agent so that 
  execution can be cancelled. The call is executed asynchronously so it returns immediately 
  and leaves the agent free to do some other work while the computation is being performed. 
  As the computation proceeds, the execution infrastructure generates feedback events 
  which are delivered to the provided <code>AgentEventListener</code> so that the 
  agent can track and update the status of the computation. When the call terminates, 
  an event is produced to inform the listener of the outcome. This way the agent can 
  start a call-end procedure to collect the results or handle any exception raised 
  during the background computation. All events are dispatched within the Swing event 
  dispatching thread, so agents won't have to deal with concurrency.</p>
<p>All this is summarized by the specification compartment in the following diagram:</p>

</table>
<p>The realization compartment outlines the internal structure of the component. A 
  call in a view maps to a command which a controller first configures and then transfers 
  to a command processor for asynchronous execution [<b>Pattern</b>: <i>Command Processor</i>]. 
  Commands can be composed to form a computation tree so that single calls to the 
  underlying data services can be easily assembled together [<b>Pattern</b>: <i>Composite</i>]. 
  The call's invoker specifies a listener to de-multiplex and process events generated 
  by the asynchronous computation [<b>Pattern</b>: <i>Asynchronous Completion Token</i>]. 
  The controller returns immediately a call handle to the invoker so that execution 
  can be cancelled -- the invoker is now free to proceed. As the computation develops, 
  an execution monitor captures execution events and relays them to the specified 
  listener [<b>Pattern</b>: <i>Observer</i>]. The monitor performs some adaptation 
  to transform the original execution events in a form suitable for the listener [<b>Pattern</b>: 
  <i>Adapter</i>] and eventually notifies the listener within the UI thread.</p>
<p>This component relies on the <code>DataManagementService</code>, <code>SemanticTypesService</code>, 
  and <code>PixelsService</code> interfaces provided by the data services. It also 
  depends on the <code>util.concur.tasks</code> package which provides the actual 
  support for asynchrony.</p>
