<body>
<p>A call in a view maps to a command (a <code>CompositeBatchCall</code> object) which 
  is maintained by a <code>BatchCallTree</code>. Concrete subclasses of <code>BatchCallTree</code> 
  build the command by aggregating single calls to the data services -- each such 
  call is represented by a concrete <code>BatchCall</code>. Typically, a command is 
  just a plain sequence of calls to the data services. However, <code>BatchCall</code> 
  and <code>CompositeBatchCall</code> provide a composite structure which can be used 
  to create more generic (and complex) computation trees where leaves (instances of 
  concrete <code>BatchCall</code>'s) are actual calls to the data services and internal 
  nodes are <code>CompositeBatchCall</code> objects that are used to build the tree 
  structure. </p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates this composite structure.</p>
