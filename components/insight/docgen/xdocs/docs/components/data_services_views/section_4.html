<p>The following diagram illustrates how the code is organized into packages and points 
  out the various dependencies among the packages.</p>

  <div class="noteLabel">Issue: Substitutability.</div>
  <div class="noteContent">This organization of the source code only allows for design-time 
    substitutability. That is, the Data Services Views is a logical component that 
    can be replaced during design by another logical component that conforms to the 
    same specification. In fact, because the component's realizations manifest 
    in the shoola.jar and are embedded with the data services, we have no run-time 
    substitutability. This issue has to be considered when addressing the same substitutability 
    issue for the data services (should be factored out in a separate jar) and we'll 
    have to decide on the granularity of physical components -- is the Data Services 
    View going to be a separate jar from the Data Services or they will both end up 
    in the same jar?</div>

  <div class="noteLabel">Issue: Dependency on Swing.</div>
  <div class="noteContent">The <code>BatchCallMonitor</code> uses <code>SwingUtilities</code> 
    to relay events within the UI thread. This dependency on Swing has to be removed, 
    obviously. In fact, this is something the <code>EventBus</code> should take care 
    of. However, the <code>EventBus</code> doesn't support dispatching of events 
    to a given listener yet.</div>
