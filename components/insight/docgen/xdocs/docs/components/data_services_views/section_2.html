<p>A data services view is a logical grouping of data and operations that
 serve a specific purpose -- for example to support dataset browsing
 by providing easy access to datasets, thumbnails, classifications, etc.  
 A data services view is defined by an interface that extends <code>
 DataServiceView</code> and consists of a collection of asynchronous calls
 that operate on (possibly) large portions of a data model in the background.
</p> 
<p>Agents obtain a reference to a given view through their registry by
 specifying the view's defining interface as follows (note the <i>
 required</i> cast on the returned reference):</p>
<pre class="code">
   XxxView view = (XxxView) 
                    registry.getDataServicesView(XxxView.class);
</pre>
<p><code>XxxView</code> is obviously a made up name for one of the 
 sub-interfaces of <code>DataServiceView</code> contained in this package.  
 All calls are carried out asynchronously with respect to the caller's thread
 and return a <code>CallHandle</code> object which can be used to cancel execution.
 This object is then typically linked to a button so that the user can cancel
 the task, like in the following example:</p>
<pre class="code">
   final CallHandle handle = view.loadSomeDataInTheBg(observer);
    
   //The above call returns immediately, so we don't have to wait.
   //While the task is carried out, we allow the user to change 
   //her mind and cancel the task:
 
   cancelButton.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
       public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
           handle.cancel();
       }
   });
</pre>
<p>The <code>observer</code> argument to the above call is an instance of
 <code>org.openmicroscopy.shoola.env.event.AgentEventListener</code>.  Normally
 all calls within a view allow to specify this argument, which is used to
 provide the caller with feedback on the progress of the task and with its
 eventual outcome.</p>
<p>Specifically, as the computation proceeds in the background, 
 <code>org.openmicroscopy.shoola.env.data.events.DSCallFeedbackEvent</code>s are 
 delivered to the <code>observer</code>.  These event objects have a status
 field which contains a textual description of the activity currently being
 carried out within the computation and a progress indicator which is set to 
 the percentage of the work done so far.  So the indicator will be <code>0
 </code> for the first feedback event and, if the computation runs to 
 completion, <code>100</code> for the last feedback event, which will always 
 have its status field set to <code>null</code> -- note that a <code>null
 </code> status is also possible for the previous events if no description
 was available at the time the event was fired.<br/>
  Moreover, any partial result that the computation makes available will be packed 
  into the feedback event.</p>
<p>It's important to keep in mind that the computation may not run to completion -- 
  either because of an exception within the computation or because the agent cancels 
  execution -- <code>CallHandle.cancel()</code>. In both cases, the feedback notification 
  won't run to completion either. However, in any case a final <code>org.openmicroscopy.shoola.env.data.events.DSCallOutcomeEvent</code> 
  is delivered to the <code>observer</code> to notify of the computation outcome -- 
  the event's methods can be used to find out the actual outcome and retrieve any 
  result or exception. Every call documents what is the returned object and what are 
  the possible exceptions so that the caller can later cast the returned value or 
  exception as appropriate.</p>  
<p>Here's the code for a prototypical observer:</p>
<pre class="code">
   public void eventFired(AgentEvent ae)
   {
       if (AE instanceof DSCallFeedbackEvent) {  //Progress notification. 
           update((DSCallFeedbackEvent) AE);  //Inform the user.
       } else {  //Outcome notification.
           DSCallOutcomeEvent oe = (DSCallOutcomeEvent) AE;
           switch (oe.getState()) {
           case DSCallOutcomeEvent.CANCELLED:  //The user cancelled.
               handleCancellation();
               break;
           case DSCallOutcomeEvent.ERROR:  //The call threw an exception.
               handleException(oe.getException());
               break;
           case DSCallOutcomeEvent.NO_RESULT:  //The call returned no value.
               handleNullResult();
               break;
           case DSCallOutcomeEvent.HAS_RESULT:  //The call returned a value.
               handleResult(oe.getResult());
           }
       }
   }
</pre>
<p>Because this logic is likely to be common to most of the observers, the <code>org.openmicroscopy.shoola.env.data.events.DSCallAdapter</code> 
  class factors it out to provide a more convenient way to write observers. Back to 
  our previous example, the <code>observer</code> could look something like the following:</p>
<pre class="code">
   observer = new DSCallAdapter() {
     public void update(DSCallFeedbackEvent fe) {  //Received some feedback.
         String status = fe.getStatus();
         int percDone = fe.getPercentDone();
         if (status == null) 
             status = (percDone == 100) ? "Done" :  //Else
                                        ""; //Description wasn't available.   
         statusBar.setText(status);  //A JLabel object part of the UI.
         progressBar.setValue(percDone); //A JProgressBar object part of the UI.
     }      
     public void onEnd() { //Called right before any of the handleXXX methods.
         progressBar.setVisible(false);  //Because the computation has finished.
     }
     Public void handleResult(Object result) {  //Computation returned a result. 
         //We have a non-null return value.  Cast it to what 
         //loadSomeDataInTheBg() declared to return.
         SomeData data = (SomeData) result;
   
         //Update model, UI, etc.
     }
     public void handleCancellation() {  //Computation was cancelled.
         UserNotifier un = registry.getUserNotifier();
         un.notifyInfo("Data Loading", "SomeData task cancelled.");
     }
     Public void handleException(Throwable exc) {  //An error occurred.
         UserNotifier UN = registry.getUserNotifier();
         un.notifyError("Data Loading Failure",
                        "Couldn't retrieve SomeData.", exc);
     }
   };
</pre>
<p>Note that the <code>observer</code>'s code in the example above works just like 
  any other <i>Swing</i> listener. In fact, all events are delivered <i>sequentially</i> 
  and within the <i>Swing</i> event dispatching thread. This means the <code>observer</code> 
  can run synchronously with respect to the UI and won't need to worry about concurrency 
  issues -- as long as it runs within <i>Swing</i>. Finally, also note that subsequent 
  feedback events imply computation progress and the <code>org.openmicroscopy.shoola.env.data.events.DSCallOutcomeEvent</code> 
  is always the last event to be delivered in order of time.</p>
