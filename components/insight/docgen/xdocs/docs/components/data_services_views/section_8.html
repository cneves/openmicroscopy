<p>We now analyze the correctness of the design with respect to safety and liveness. 
  We make use of confinement techniques to guarantee that only one thread will ever 
  traverse and execute a call tree, as exemplified by the following diagram which 
  describes the common invocation pattern:</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="images/threading.gif" width="700" height="560" /></td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="10">&#160;</td></tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="center"><a name="fig_8-1"><b>Fig 8-1</b></a>: Threading.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"><hr width="80%" align="center"/></td></tr>
</table>
<p>Because of how the interaction is structured follows that any two threads can never 
  share, at the same time, references to the command, monitor, and <code>BathCallTree</code> 
  object (linked to the monitor). In fact, when the <code>CmdProcessor</code> has 
  a thread execute the command, that thread will be the only one from which references 
  to those objects are accessible. This means no locking is required to ensure safety 
  and, because we have no locks, those objects can't suffer from liveness failures. 
  However for this to work in practice, the implementation has to take great care 
  in ensuring that:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every method within a view follows the pattern outlined in the diagram.</li>
  <li>An instance of a concrete subclass of <code>BatchCallTree</code> never lets 
    escape references to the nodes that were added to the tree during the invocation 
    of <code>buildTree()</code>. Ideally, nodes would be created, added, and de-referenced 
    within <code>buildTree()</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The <code>BatchCallTree</code> explicitly checks at runtime that the first constraint 
  is met -- it makes sure that one thread at most can ever invoke <code>exec()</code>, 
  so to make it impossible for a view to recycle a <code>BatchCallTree</code> object 
  across different calls. However, its subclasses are trusted to enforce the latter 
  constraint. (The implementation can eventually be refined to check for that as well.)</p>
<p>Because the monitor relays execution events to the observer (the <code>AgentEventListener</code> 
  object specified by the agent) within the Swing event dispatching thread, whatever 
  the actual implementation of the observer is not going to impact the safety and 
  liveness properties discussed above. Also note that a view's method can be safely 
  called concurrently from several threads -- although agents should avoid spawning 
  threads, this is not going to be a problem because the <code>BatchCallTree</code> 
  object is method-scoped. Finally, the returned call handle can be safely shared 
  among different threads -- even though this is not something very useful for an 
  agent to do.</p>
<p>Even though objects from the underlying data services fall out of the scope of 
  this discussion, we now point out safety issues that arise from their use in a multi-threaded 
  environment. We saw that a call tree is basically private to the execution thread. 
  However, the objects manipulated by the leaf nodes (which make the actual calls 
  to the underlying data services) may not. Specifically, all calls to the data services 
  that involve passing or obtaining pre-existing data objects are not safe -- basically 
  all update/reload calls. This is because the data services rely on ome-java which 
  is not completely thread-safe. Calls that obtain new data objects (data loading) 
  are safe :though.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<div class="noteFrame">
  <div class="noteLabel">Issue: Thread-safety within ome-java.</div>
  <div class="noteContent">Asses whether this library takes into account how multiple 
    threads could concurrently affect the state of the objects it manipulates. If 
    it doesn't, then it's not safe to use in a multi-threaded environment. For example, 
    say agent A asynchronously calls an update method to remove dataset d1 from project 
    p1, which also contains datasets d2. Meanwhile, agent B calls the same update 
    method to remove all datasets from p1.<br/>
    NOTE: If not completely thread-safe, an easy solution would be to use a queued 
    command processor so that all calls to ome-java still happen in the background, 
    but are serialized. However, this is sub-optimal if you have several long tasks 
    that could be run concurrently -- for example loading all thumbnails in a 
    dataset and retrieving all metadata in another dataset. Another option would be 
    to have an agent always wait for the result of an async call before making another 
    one. Sadly, this would only work if we keep all agent's data private to that agent, 
    which would kind of go against object identity and caching.</div>
