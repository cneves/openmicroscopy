<p>The following diagram depicts the dependencies among targets and the files in which 
  they are contained.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><img src="images/targets.gif" width="620" height="550"/></td>
  </tr>

  <tr> 
    <td align="center"><a name="fig_5.2-1"><b>Fig 5.2-1</b></a>: Targets, dependencies, 
	  and build files.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td height="40"><hr width="80%" align="center"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The boxes labelled with <i>artifact</i> represent build files. The boxes with the 
  target icon on the right are build targets. The placement of targets within build 
  file boxes denotes containment -- for example, the <code>init</code> target is 
  contained in the <i>build.xml</i> file. Dashed arrows denote build dependencies 
  -- for example <code>app-init</code> in <i>app.xml</i> depends on <code>init</code> 
  in <i>build.xml</i>. The boxes with a folded corner are notes.</p>
<p>All the available public targets are highlighted in the diagram. All these targets 
  have already been described in this document. You can find out more about them by 
  reading the inline documentation that accompanies each build file. Also refer to 
  the various build files for a description of what the private targets do.</p>
<p>On a final note, it's worth mentioning that, by design, it's not possible to create 
  a distribution bundle (either generic or OS X) if part of the application doesn't 
  compile or any test fails. In fact, <code>dist</code> and <code>dist-osx</code> 
  both depend (indirectly) on <code>dist-init</code> which, in turn, depends on <code>test</code>. 
  This latter target fails the build if any test within the application test suite 
  fails. The <code>compile</code> and <code>test-compile</code> targets both fail 
  the build in the case of a compilation error. Because of the dependencies layout, 
  <code>test</code> can't be executed if <code>compile</code> or <code>test-compile</code> 
  fails. Which explains why it's not possible to create a distribution bundle in the 
  case of a (even partial) compilation failure.</p>
