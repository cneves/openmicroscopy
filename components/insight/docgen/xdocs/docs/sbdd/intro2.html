The primary audience of this document is system administrators and power-users
that wish to build the software (or any other available project artifact, like 
documentation) from scratch. We assume the reader has some familiarity with the
Unix/Windows shells and a minimum knowledge of the Java Runtime Environment.</p> 
<p>
This document is also very useful as a guide to new developers and is a handy 
reference for all other OMERO.insight developers. Moreover, the section on the design
of the build system contains important information for the development and 
maintenance of the build system itself. This is more technical information and 
is only targeted to developers.</p>
