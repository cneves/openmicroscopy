  <title>Build System Design</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>The build system is Ant-based and is composed of several build files. We use some 
  new Ant features that support complex build systems, so Ant 1.6 or later is required. 
  This section focuses on the breakdown of the build system into build files and the 
  dependencies among targets. Because the various build files already contain detailed 
  information, here we just provide the extra information that you will need to understand 
  how all the parts fit together. We also describe the build tool and finally provide 
  a rationale for the design.</p>
