<p>OMERO is a client/server system. The server software stores, manages, 
and analyzes 
  image data and metadata. A server site encompasses data and image servers and is 
  deployed on a powerful server machine. The OMERO servers expose network interfaces 
  so that client software can connect to them and perform tasks on behalf of users. 
  OMERO.insight is one of such clients. Client software is 
  (usually) deployed on desktop 
  machines or workstations.</p>
<p>Installing and running OMERO.insight is very easy: drop the 
distribution directory somewhere 
  on your filesystem and run! This section details 
  all this more precisely. An obvious pre-requisite is that the 
  OMERO server site you 
  intend to connect to is up and running and you have a valid account.</p>
