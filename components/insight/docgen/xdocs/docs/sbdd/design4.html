<p>This section provides a brief discussion and justification of the design choices 
  underpinning the build system.</p>
<p>First off, we chose Ant to implement the build system because of its excellent 
  support for Java projects and its ubiquity among Java developers. We decided for 
  version 1.6 (the latest stable release at the time of writing) because of the new 
  features to support large projects, like <i>antlibs</i> and <i>imports</i>. In fact, 
  this easily allowed us to split the build process in different categories of tasks 
  and arrange the corresponding targets into separate files according to the category 
  they belong to, thus making for improved understandability and ease of maintenance. 
  Moreover, the definition of custom tasks could be factored out in a library file 
  and shared among all build files. Some of those tasks were defined through scripts. 
  The reason for that as opposed to a custom Ant task in Java is the reduced overhead 
  and time required to write and integrate the code. Of course, this is feasible only 
  in the case of tasks of moderate complexity.</p>
<p>The little extra work required for the build tool was justified by the fact that 
  this tool:</p>
<ul>
  <li><i>Simplifies the build configuration</i>. In fact, a prerequisite to running 
    the build system under Ant is that all the external libraries are properly configured 
    and linked to the Ant runtime. On top of that, extra work could be needed if different 
    versions of the libraries required by the build system have already been configured 
    on the machine where the build is run. (Recall that some of those libraries depend 
    on specific versions of other libraries and newer versions wouldn't work.)</li>
  <li><i>Avoids upgrading to Ant 1.6</i>. If you have an earlier version of Ant, you 
    can still run a build with the build tool without having to upgrade.</li>
  <li><i>Avoids keeping up with build system updates</i>. If you're using Ant to run 
    the build system, then every time a new custom task and external library is added 
    you'll have to update your local Ant configuration.</li>
  <li><i>Allows to replicate a build on different machines</i>. In fact, when the 
    build tool is used, the only thing that might change across machines is the JDK. 
    In practice, this results in a likelihood close to 100% of reproducing a build.</li>
  <li><i>Avoids potential problems in the future</i>. Even if a future version of 
    Ant would break our build, we can still run it with the build tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>A final remark. All the libraries required by the build system are kept under the 
  <i>build/tools</i> directory. We didn't put them under the <i>LIB</i> directory, 
  because they have nothing to do with the application and test code. For the sake 
  of clarity it's better to keep different things in different places.</p>
