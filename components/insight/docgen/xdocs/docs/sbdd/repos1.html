<p>The <i>shoola-omero</i> Subversion module is the repository of the software 
artifacts of the 
OMERO.insight project. Its contents are as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li><i>build</i>: This directory contains the tools to compile, run, test, and deliver 
    the application.</li>
  <li><i>config</i>: Various configuration files required by the application to run.</li>
  <li><i>docgen</i>: Documentation artifacts that are used to build actual documents. 
    These are organized in two sub-directories: <i>javadoc</i> and <i>xdocs</i>. The 
    former only contains resources (like CSS files) to generate programmer's documentation 
    (JavaDoc) -- the actual documentation contents are obtained from the source code. 
    The latter contains both resources (like stylesheets and Java code) to generate 
    all other kinds of documentation (like design and users documents) and the actual 
    documentation contents in the form of XML/HTML files.</li>
  <li><i>launch</i>: Launcher scripts and installation instructions bundled with the 
    default application distribution file. Its sub-directories contain further resources 
    to build platform-specific distributions.</li>
  <li><i>legal</i>: Terms and conditions under which the various artifacts in the 
    shoola-omero SVN module are released. A README file specifies which license applies 
    to which artifact.</li>
  <li><i>LIB</i>: All library files required by the application. Its <i>test </i> 
    sub-directory contains additional libraries required by the test code.</li>
  <li><i>SRC</i>: Contains the application source files.</li>
  <li><i>TEST</i>: The test code.</li>
  <li><i>CodeTemplate</i>: This file describes the coding style that all source files 
    should conform to.</li>
  <li><i>README</i>: old trustworthy README file.</li>
</ul>
