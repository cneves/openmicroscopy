<p>In order to run OMERO.insight, your system must have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A processor of 1GHz or faster.</li>
  <li>A minimum of 256MB of RAM. (We strongly recommend 512MB.)</li>
  <li>A network link of 100Mb (possibly dedicated) between your machine and the 
  OMERO server site you intend to connect to.</li>
  <li>A Java Runtime Environment, 1.5 or later.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="noteContent">In principle, the software should run on <i>any</i> Java 
    Runtime Environment -- 1.5 or later. However, we've only been testing the system 
    extensively on Linux/Blackdown JVM, Mac OS X/Apple JVM, Windows/Sun JVM -- all 
    of which are 1.5 JVMs. </div>
