<p>Installing and running OMERO.insight is pretty easy. The following paragraphs detail the 
  procedure to follow if you're using the build system or have downloaded/generated 
  the generic or Mac OS X distribution bundle.</p>
<h5><i>Generic Bundle</i></h5>
<p>If you want to install the generic distribution bundle, just extract the archive 
  contents into the directory in which you intend to install. 
  To run, just launch the start-up script for your 
  platform -- the installation directory contains scripts for Mac OS X, Unix, 
  and Windows. A splash screen will pop up, enter a new server address or select
  a previously entered one, your user name and password to log 
  onto the selected OMERO server site.</p>

  <div class="noteContent">We experienced problems with some GUI tools that deflate 
    zip archives on Unix-like platforms. The original file permissions were ignored/overwritten 
    during the archive extraction phase. (Indeed, there's no portable way to store 
    these permissions. We use the Ant zip task which in turn uses the algorithm used 
    by the default versions of zip and unzip for many Unix-like systems.) This resulted 
    in having to set the executable bit for some files manually after the extraction 
    of the archive contents. If you're experiencing similar problems, then proceed 
    as follows after unzipping. Move to your installation directory and from there 
    type, at the command prompt: <code>chmod +x *.sh</code></div>
</div>

<h5><i>Mac OS X Bundle</i></h5>
<p>If you want to install the Mac OS X distribution bundle, just extract the archive 
  contents into the directory in which you intend to install. 
  To run, just double-click on the OMERO.insight icon 
  in your installation directory. A splash screen will pop up, enter a new server 
  address or select a previously entered one, your user name and password to log 
  onto the selected OMERO server site.</p>

<div class="noteFrame">
  <div class="noteLabel">Note for Linux/Mac OS X/Unix</div>
  <div class="noteContent"> As already mentioned, we experienced problems with some 
    GUI tools that deflate zip archives. If you double-click on the OMERO.insight icon and 
    the application doesn't start, then probably file permissions haven't been set 
    properly during the archive extraction phase. The fix is easy: open up a terminal 
    and <code>cd</code> to your installation directory. From there, again <code>cd</code> 
    to <i>OMERO.insight.app/Contents/MacOS</i>. Now type: <code>chmod +x JavaApplicationStub</code></div>
