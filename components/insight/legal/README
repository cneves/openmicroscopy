  Third-Party Software Licenses
  -----------------------------
  
  We are in debt with many open-source projects for providing us with valuable
  artifacts, ranging from application libraries to graphics files. This section
  lists all the third-party software that is used by OMERO.insight.

  using the following format:
  
  Project: The name of the project the artifacts belong to and a brief 
  		(optional) description.
  Web Site: The project's Web site address.
  Artifacts: The files our software makes use of.  The wildcard character * can
  		be appended to a sequence of characters S denoting a file name.  
  		This shall mean 'all the files whose name starts with S'.  For example, 
  		'ant-*' means all the files whose name starts with 'ant-'.
  		Unless otherwise specified, directory pathnames are given relative to 
  		the root of the Shoola SVN module.
